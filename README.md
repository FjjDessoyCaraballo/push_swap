# push_swap
## Description:
The goal of this project is to sort numbers given in the terminal. The scope of the project allows negative numbers and the use of two stacks.

We have to sort these numbers with a limited number of actions: swap, push, and rotate. In our stack, we may:
- swap the first and second elements (sa, sb, ss);
- push from stack a to b and vice-versa (pa, pb);
- rotate the first element all the way down or the last element all the way up (ra, ra, rr, rra, rrb, rrr).

## Usage:
**MacOs and Linux**
- `git clone https://github.com/FjjDessoyCaraballo/push_swap`
- Make the files
- Use the ```./push_swap [numbers that you desire to sort separated by space]```
- Profit $$$
